#Chapter 2: Exercises 1~5
#Exercise 1: Variables. Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.

Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
name=" \n  Antonio \t   "
print(name)
print(name.lstrip())
print(name.rstrip())
print(name.strip())

#Exercise 5: USB Shopper. A girl heads to a computer shop to buy some USB sticks. She loves USB sticks and wants as many as she can get for £50. They are £6 each.

usb_bought= 50//6
money_left=50%6
print("A girl heads to a computer shop to buy some USB sticks. She loves USB sticks and wants as many as she can get for £50. She can buy",usb_bought,"USB sticks and the amount of money she has left is",str(money_left)+".")
